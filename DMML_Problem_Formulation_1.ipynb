        "Customer churn occurs when an existing customer stops using a company’s services or purchasing its products, ending their relationship with the company. Churn leads to revenue decline, increased cost of acquiring new customers, and potential loss of market share as former customers may influence others and join competitors. Our focus is on addressable churn—where timely intervention can retain these customers, rather than non-addressable churn (e.g., due to death). Predicting and reducing churn is critical for sustainable business growth[2][47].\n",
