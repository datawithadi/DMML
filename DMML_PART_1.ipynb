        "### 1. Business Problem Definition\n",
        "\n",
        "Customer churn represents the loss of existing customers who stop using a company's services or products, leading to direct revenue decline and increased acquisition costs to replace lost customers. The challenge is to proactively identify which customers are likely to churn (specifically \"addressable churn\" where interventions are possible) by leveraging data from multiple sources and deploying a predictive machine learning model. This enables timely retention efforts and prevents further business impact from indirect effects, such as customers influencing others to leave or switching to competitors.\n",

        "- Proactively identify at-risk customers before they churn.\n",
        "- Enable targeted retention strategies (e.g., personalized offers, customer support intervention).\n",
        "- Reduce overall churn rate to minimize revenue loss and acquisition costs.\n",
        "- Continuously monitor and improve model performance and retention strategy effectiveness.\n",
        "- Support data-driven decision-making across departments (sales, marketing, product).\n",
